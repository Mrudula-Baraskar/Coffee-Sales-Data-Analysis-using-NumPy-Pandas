☕ Coffee Sales Data Analysis (Learning Project)
📌 About This Project

This project is created for learning NumPy and Pandas using real data.

It focuses on:

Understanding real CSV datasets

Practicing NumPy logic instead of only theory

Learning step-by-step data analysis

Improving problem-solving and programming thinking

This is not an advanced project.
It is a foundation-building project.

🛠 Tools Used

Python

NumPy for calculations and logic

Pandas for reading and preparing data

📂 Dataset Explanation

The dataset contains coffee shop sales records.

Each row represents one transaction.

Columns:

datetime → Date and time of sale

coffee_name → Coffee type

money → Amount earned

cash_type → Payment method

🔹 Project Steps (Short Overview)
Step 1: Load Data

CSV file loaded using Pandas

Pandas is used because it works well with tabular data and NumPy

Step 2: Data Cleaning

Converted money column to float for calculations

Converted datetime column to datetime format to extract time information

Step 3: Basic Sales Statistics

Calculated using NumPy:

Total sales

Average sales

Maximum sale

Minimum sale

📘 Learned that NumPy functions can replace loops and make code cleaner.

Step 4: Best-Selling Coffee

Identified unique coffee types

Calculated total sales per coffee

Found the top-selling coffee

📘 Learned how business questions turn into NumPy logic.

Step 5: Payment Method Analysis

Calculated total sales per payment method

Counted transactions per payment type

📘 Learned filtering and correct result storage.

Step 6: Hourly Sales Analysis

Extracted hour from datetime

Calculated total sales per hour

Found the busiest hour

📘 Learned time-based analysis used in real businesses.

Step 7: Coffee Popularity by Hour

Checked which coffee sells most each hour

📘 Uses loops for now because this is a learning stage.

🧠 What I Learned

How NumPy works on real data

Difference between filtering and replacing values

Importance of data shape and structure

How logic matters more than syntax

⚠ Current Limitations

Some parts use loops

Code can be optimized more

No visual charts yet

🚀 Future Improvements

Replace loops with full NumPy vectorization

Add graphs using Matplotlib

Write reusable functions

💡 Why This Project Matters to Me

This project helped me:

Move from beginner thinking to structured thinking

Reduce dependency on loops

Understand real-world data analysis

Build confidence in NumPy
